  "description": "##Objective To make a lightweight, RESTFUL server which has GET, POST, and DELETE CRUD methods and tests which verify common functionality of these methods.  Furthermore, a connection with a Mongo DB instance is created and information may be stored for later retrieval.  The object created for storage is a Bicycle with a schema identifying the brand, model, and discipline it is intended for.  Mongo auto generates a unique ID and timestamp which follow the object into the DB.",
